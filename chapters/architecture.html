			<p>The software industry delights in taking words and stretching them into a myriad of subtly contradictory
meanings. One of the biggest sufferers is "architecture." I tend to look at "architecture" as one of those
impressive-sounding words, used primarily to indicate that we're talking something that's important. But I'm
pragmatic enough not to let my cynicism get in the way of attracting people to my book. :-)
"Architecture" is a term that lots of people try to define, with little agreement. There are two common
elements: One is the highest-level breakdown of a system into its parts; the other, decisions that are hard to
change. It's also increasingly realized that there isn't just one way to state a system's architecture; rather,
there are multiple architectures in a system, and the view of what is architecturally significant is one that can
change over a system's lifetime.
From time to time Ralph Johnson has a truly remarkable posting on a mailing list, and he did one on
architecture just as I was finishing the draft of this book. In this posting he brought out the point that
architecture is a subjective thing, a shared understanding of a system's design by the expert developers on a
project. Commonly this shared understanding is in the form of the major components of the system and how
they interact. It's also about decisions, in that it's the decisions that developers wish they could get right
early on because they're perceived as hard to change. The subjectivity comes in here as well because, if you
find that something is easier to change than you once thought, then it's no longer architectural. In the end
architecture boils down to the important stuffâ€”whatever that is.
In this book I present my perception of the major parts of an enterprise application and of the decisions I
wish I could get right early on. The architectural pattern I like the most is that of layers, which I describe
more in Chapter 1. This book is thus about how you decompose an enterprise application into layers and
how these layers work together. Most nontrivial enterprise applications use a layered architecture of some
form, but in some situations other approaches, such as pipes and filters, are valuable. I don't go into those
situations, focusing instead on the context of a layered architecture because it's the most widely useful.
Some of the patterns in this book can reasonably be called architectural, in that they represent significant
decisions about these parts; others are more about design and help you to realize that architecture. I don't
make any strong attempt to separate the two, since what is architectural or not is so subjective.</p>
