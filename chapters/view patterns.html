On the view side there are three patterns to think about: Transform View(361), Template View(350),and
Two Step View(365).These give rise to essentially two choices: whether to use Transform View(361)or
Template View(350),and whether either of them uses one stage or a Two Step View(365).The basic
patterns for Transform View(361)and Template View(350)are single stage. Two Step View(365)is a
variation you can apply to either.
I'll start with the choice between Template View(350)and Transform View(361). Template View(350)
allows you write the presentation in the structure of the page and embed markers into the page to indicate
where dynamic content needs to go. Quite a few popular platforms are based on this pattern, many of which
are the server pages technologies (ASP, JSP, PHP) that allow you to put a full programming language into
the page. This clearly provides a lot of power and flexibility; sadly, it also leads to very messy code that's
difficult to maintain. As a result if you use server page technology you must be very disciplined to keep
programming logic out of the page structure, often by using a helper object.
The Transform View(361)uses a transform style of program. The usual example is XSLT. This can be very
effective if you're working with domain data that's in XML format or can easily be converted to it. An input
controller picks the appropriate XSLT stylesheet and applies it to XML gleaned from the model.
If you use procedural scripts as your view, you can write the code in the style of either  Transform View(361)
or Template View(350)or in some interesting mix of the two. I've noticed that most scripts follow one of
these two patterns as their main form.
The second decision is whether to be single stage (see Figure 4.2)  or to use Two Step View(365).
A singlestage view mostly has one view component for each screen in the application. The view takes domain
oriented data and renders it in HTML. I say "mostly" because similar logical screens may share views. Even
so, most of the time you can think of it as one view per screen.<p/>

			<p> A two-stage view ( Figure 4.3)  breaks this process into two stages, producing a logical screen from the
domain data and then rendering it in HTML. There's one first-stage view for each screen but only one
second-stage view for the whole application.</p>
			<h4>Figure 4.3. A two-stage view</h4>
			<img src="../pictures/view_2.png" height="405" width="566">
			<p> The advantage of the Two Step View(365)is that it puts the decision of what HTML to use in a single place.
This makes global changes to the HTML easy since there's only one object to alter in order to alter every
screen on the site. Of course, you only get that advantage if your logical presentation stays the same, so it
works best with sites where different screens use the same basic layout. Highly design intensive sites won't
be able to come up with a good logical screen structure.</p>
			<p>Two Step View(365)works even better if you have a Web application where its services are being used by
multiple front-end customers, such as multiple airlines fronting the same basic reservation system. Within
the limits of the logical screen, each front end can have a different appearance by using a different second
stage. In a similar way you can use a Two Step View(365)to handle different output devices, with separate
second stages for a regular Web browser and for a palmtop. Again, the limitation is that you can have the
two share a common logical screen, which may not be possible if the UIs are very different, such as in a
browser and a cell phone.</p>
